"""Undo / Redo management for Enhanced Word server.

This module keeps an in-memory history (list of binary snapshots) for every
.docx file path that is being modified by the tools.  The history is captured
just before a file is written â€“ see utils.file_utils.check_file_writeable,
which calls ``snapshot``.

A single public tool (see tools/undo_tools.py) exposes user-facing operations
without increasing the overall MCP tool count dramatically.
